# Neovim Configuration

This is a git repo of my [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) configuration.

This is personal setup that works for me and not meant as a recommendation to anyone on what a good setup should be.

To use this configuration, clone this repo into your `~/.config/nvim` folder using the below command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rrmistry/rrmistry.nvim "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```
